    - **LegacyWindowsExploits	N/A**	Well..
    - **Ops	N/A**	Contains a lot of awesome tools and python / dss scripts used by DanderSpritz. Deserves a lot of investigation. includes tools to gather data from Chrome, Skype, Firefox (ripper) and gather information about the machine / environment (survey)
    - **Pfree	Passfreely**	Oracle implant that bypasses auth for oracle databases
    - **PaCU	PaperCut**	Allows you to perform operations on file handles opened by other processes

    - **TeDi	TerritorialDispute**	A plugin used to determine what other (malicious) software may be persistently installed (based on TeDi/PyScripts/sigs.py). Appears to be used to identify other nation states also
    - **Utbu	UtilityBurst**	Appears to be a mechanism for persistence via a driver install unsure (based on UtBu/Scripts/Include/\_UtilityBurstFunctions.dsi)
    - **ZBng	ZippyBang**	Looking at this quickly, it appears to be the NSA's version of Mimikatz. It can duplicate tokens (Kerberos tokens?) and "remote execute commands" as well as logon as users (based on files in ZBng/Commands/CommandLine)
