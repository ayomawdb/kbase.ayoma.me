- IA-32 CPU architecture 
  - General Purpose Registers (V1 C3.4.1): 
    - EAX - accumulator
    - EBX - pointer to data in DS segment
    - ECX - counter for string and loop operations 
    - EDX - I/O pointer
    - ESI 
      - Pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS register

      - `cld` to **cl**ear **d**irection flag
      - `std` to **s**e**t** **d**irection flag
      - String operation
        - ESI/EDI: must point to either to start/end of the string
        - ECX must contain number of bytes to compare 
    - IOPL (**IO** **p**rivilege **l**evel) - OS operations 
    - Trap Flag - Enable single step mode (debugging)

    - CS - code
    - DS - data
    - SS - stack
    - ES - data
    - FS - data
    - GS - data
  - EIP - Instruction Pointer Register = PC (V1 C3.5)
    -  Cannot access directly
  - DR0 - DR7: Debug Registers (V3 C317.2)
    - DR0 - DR3 are important: Used to store hardware breakpoints (addresses)
    - Cannot be accessed directly from userland (Ring-3)
    - In Windows use Ring 3 API and transfer execution to kernel level to update the register 
  - Machine/Model Specific Registers  (V1 C3.2)
    - Not accessible to applications, except from Time-Stamp Counter 
    - 64-bit 
    - Read using RDTSC (Read time-stamp counter) 
      - Low read to EAX
      - High read to EDX
    - Incremented with every clock cycle (reset when processor reset)
- CPU has a thread-wise context
- Software breakpoints work by 0xCC (int 3h) instruction. Core modification, is independent from thread context.
- Functions
  - Why functions are required in a program
  - Execution flow changes and it's required to remember where the execution was left off (and registers)
  - Introduce stack (SS)
- Stack: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/The_Stack>
  - Process: 
    - Contain threads
    - Created by OS and provided with a virtual address space 
    - OS creates at least one thread, ready to be executed
  - Thread:
    - Has it's own stack
    - Share the same virtual address space (of process)
    - Time slice assigned by processor to that specific process 
    - Singe processor system: One thread at a time
    - Multi processor system: Simultaneous threads 
  - Multi-tasking: Illusion of simultaneous execution of multiple application at the same time 
  - Multi-threading: Multiple threads that actually run in parallel
  - PUSH POP - LIFO and bottom to top  nature
    - ESP always point to TOS is decremented to point to new place  
      - Addition decrement 
      - Removal increment
- Function calling (V1 C6): <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Functions_and_Stack_Frames>
  - Parameters pushed to stack 
  - CALL 
    - Push return address to (return IP) ti stack
    - Load the address of the function's entry-point (to EIP)
  - RET
    - POP address from TOS to EIP and resume execution 
    - RET 4. RET + increment ESP 4 bytes (used in `stdcall` and `fastcall`) 
  - Stack frames (V1 C6) 
    - Each function need a way to store return/local variables etc.
    - Function `prologue` create a frame for each function 
      - After this some GP registers stored in stack
    - Function `epilogue` re-balance the stack (free memory) after execution
      - Before this GP registers are restored
  - prologue: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue>
    ```bash
    push ebp      # save base pointer
    mov	ebp, esp  # set the base-pointer, so that it points to the top of the stack
    sub	esp, N    # allocate memory for current stack frame
    ```
    ```bash
    enter	N, 0   # More complex prologues can be obtained using different values (other than 0)
    ```
  - function invocation
    ```bash
    push eax    # save registers
    push ebx

    # Function body 

    pop ebx    # restore saved registers
    pop eax
    ```
  - epilogue:
    ```bash
    mov esp, ebp   # free memory allocated for current stack frame 
    pop ebp        # restore previous base pointer 
    ret            # exit function
    ```
    ```bash
    leave
	ret
    ```
  - Calling conventions: <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Calling_Conventions>
    - `cdecl`
      - Arguments are passed on the stack in `Right-to-Left` order, and `return values are passed in eax`.
      - The `calling function cleans` the stack. 
        - CDECL functions to have variable-length argument lists (aka variadic functions)
        - Number of arguments is not appended to the name of the function by the compiler, and the assembler and the linker are therefore unable to determine if an incorrect number of arguments is used.
      - CDECL functions are almost always prepended with an `_`. 
        ```c
        _cdecl int MyFunction1(int a, int b)
        {
        return a + b;
        }

        x = MyFunction1(2, 3);
        ```
        ```bash
        _MyFunction1:
        push ebp              # prologue
        mov ebp, esp          # prologue
        mov eax, [ebp + 8]    # read 1st param into eax
        mov edx, [ebp + 12]   # read 2nd param into abx
        add eax, edx          
        pop ebp               # epilogue
        ret                   # epilogue

        push 3                # push rightmost param into stack (b)
        push 2                # push next-rightmost param into stack (a)
        call _MyFunction1     # call
        add esp, 8            # calling function cleans (free memory)
        ```
  - `stdcall` (WINAPI)
    - Exclusively by Microsoft as the standard calling convention for the Win32 API
    - Arguments are passed on the stack in `Right-to-Left` order, and `return values are passed in eax`. (same as `__cdecl`)
    - The `called function cleans` the stack, unlike CDECL. 
      - STDCALL doesn't allow variable-length argument lists.
    - Name-decorated with a leading `_`, followed by an `@`, and then the `number (in bytes)` of arguments passed on the stack. This number will always be a multiple of 4, on a 32-bit aligned machine.
    - Resulting code is smaller because `clean up` instructions are not repeated with each invocation. 
        ```c
        _stdcall int MyFunction2(int a, int b)
        {
        return a + b;
        }

        x = MyFunction2(2, 3);
        ```
        ```bash
        :_MyFunction2@8       # Function name contains info about number of bytes to clean
        push ebp              # prologue
        mov ebp, esp          # prologue
        mov eax, [ebp + 8]    # read 1st param into eax
        mov edx, [ebp + 12]   # read 2nd param into abx
        add eax, edx          
        pop ebp               # epilogue
        ret 8                 # epilogue + called function cleans (free memory). 8 is how many bytes to pop off.

        push 3                # push rightmost param into stack (b)
        push 2                # push next-rightmost param into stack (a)
        call _MyFunction2@8   # call
        ```
  - `fastcall`
    - not completely standard across all compilers
    - first 2 or 3 32-bit (or smaller) arguments are passed in registers, with the most commonly used registers being `edx`, `eax`, and `ecx`
    - Additional arguments, or arguments larger than 4-bytes are passed on the stack, often in `Right-to-Left` order (similar to CDECL)
    - `Calling function cleans` most frequently
    - prepends an `@` to the function name, and follows the function name with `@x`, where x is the number (in bytes) of arguments
    - FASTCALL function doesn't need a stack frame
    - Commonly `gcc` and `Windows FASTCALL` convention pushes parameters one and two into `ecx` and `edx`, respectively, before pushing any remaining parameters onto the stack.
        ```c
        _fastcall int MyFunction3(int a, int b)
        {
        return a + b;
        }

        x = MyFunction3(2, 3);
        ```
        ```bash
        :@MyFunction3@8
        push ebp           # prologue
        mov ebp, esp       # prologue
        add ecx, edx       # a is in ecx, b is in edx
        pop ebp            # epilogue
        ret                # epilogue

        mov ecx, 2         # move rightmost param to eax 
        mov edx, 3         # move next-rightmost param to edx
        call @MyFunction3@8 
        ```
- Read EIP (used in `relocatable code`)
  - Move return address (EIP) to the EAX register
    ```
    GetEIP proc 
    mov eax, dword ptr ss:[esp]
    ret
    GetEIP endp
    ```
  - Put the address of previous instruction executed into EAX. Usable to locate other parts of code in memory (by adding  / subtracting to EIP value):  
    ```
    Call _getEIP
    _getEIP: pop eax
    ```
- Heaps - Dynamically & runtime allocated memory (used to store data that doesn't fit in stack)
- Handles - References to resources. Used by OS to control resource access. 
  - Example: To access a file need to create a file-handle using Windows API.
- Exceptions: Events occurred during runtime. and handlers to handle events. 
  - Hardware exceptions: Bad sequence (div by zero). OS map to error codes.
  - Software exceptions: 
  - Windows implements: `Structured Exception Handling (SEH)` to handle both software and hardware exceptions.

    - Save changes with right-click, save to executable. right-click save-file. 
  - Looking at memory regions 
  - PE information: Right click "PE header" memory section -> dump in cpu -> right-click in dump -> special -> PE header
    - Check offset value and go to that address 
    - Beginning of section: `from memory view`
    - Actual beginning of section within binary:  `PointerToRawData`
  - Find offset within binary:
    - `offset within code section` = (`address of the instruction` - `start address of code section`)
    - `offset within code section` + `PointerToRawData of the code section` = `exact location within binary`
