## Parenting 

### Neuroscience for Parenting

- `Oxytocin` - Love hormone responsible of reorganizing neurons while parenting
  - Also responsible of `Us vs Them` behavior 
  - In-group and out-group dynamics 
  - Feeling part of a group (protect a group)

#### The Reptilian Brain

- Survival of individual
- When active: People act in treat stress mode
- Active when there is danger / perceived danger 
- Responsible of dealing with life threatening situations
- Works closely with `limbic amygdala`
- Three ways of responding to a threat:
  - Flee
    - Lead to love, movement and change 
  - Fight
    - Lead to challenges and winning
  - Freeze
    - Lead to sharing and caring
  - Standby - *Active even where there is no active danger*
    - Lead to contemplation and thinking
- Reptilian Brain also gets activated when life is not in danger
  - Stress - Defense mechanism to a persevered danger
  - When feeling stresses
    - Flee -> Anxiety
    - Fight ->  Aggressively
    - Freeze -> Helplessness
- Reptilian Baby
  - During first 3 months, 90% of neural connections are disappeared based on surrounding
  - For a newborns slightest discomfort will trigger `Reptilian Brain` (life threatening)
  - For a baby cry is the only action but could be due to, Flee, Fight or Freeze:
  - Before 2-years, given them what they want
  - `Prefrontal brain` is responsible of Handling emotional pain
    - 17 years + development to avoid humiliation
    - 24 years + to fully develop 
  - To handle stress of children - Show that you are on their side
    - Flee
      - Movement and avoid confrontation
        - Solution: Give options 
        - Solution: Humor 
    - Fight
      - Overpowering and winning
        - Solution: Share outrage 
        - Solution: If kid is upset due to something you did, acknowledge feeling
          - "I understand you are angry right now"
          - "You have right to be upset"
    - Freeze
      - Looking for protection (ex: tears / not-doing-anything)
        - Solution: Offer support
        - Solution: Be there
    - Common Solution: Offer a hug (tell if they want a hug they can have it later)
      - Releases `oxytocin`. Bonding hormone.
      - Fight stress is defensive aggression, which happens when `Reptilian Brain` is active. 
- Movement
  - Main purpose of brain is to facilitate movement
  - 50% of neurons are from `Cerebellum`  is responsible of coordination of movement
  - This is the part of brain mostly grown at first 3 months of a newborns
  - Hence, movement is key to development of a child
  - Climbing, balancing, obstacle avoidance increase the brain growth (any activity that require constant attention on what uld happen next)
- Food
  - Sense of hunger is gen by `hypothalamus` 
  - Brain is 73% water
  - 60% of remaining 28% is fat 
  - Highest quality fat is: `Omega 3`, can be found in:
    - `fatty fish` (salmon, sadin)
    - Nuts
    - Milk and eggs (natural ones)
- Sleep
  - Own bed rule
  - Co-sleeping is important 

#### Paleolimbic Brain

- Survival of group
- When active: People act in very territorial way
  - Tries to impress and intimidate 
- Unconscious scripts inherited from education which regulates life
- Responsible of:
  - Self-confidence
    - Too-much: Dominance - Think of himself as superior to others
    - Too-less: Submissiveness - Causes melancholic depression
  - Trust
    - Too-much: Axiality - Results in gullibility 
    - Too-less: Marginality

- `limbic amygdala` is responsible of parental instincts and territorial power games related to protecting kids 
  - Ex: Fight with much larger predators when offspring is in danger 
- When someone is in this mode, better to let him calm down. No point of talking.
- Paleolimbic Toddler
  - Paleolimbic brain activated at 2 / 2.5 + years 
  - (Start playing together as a group)
  - Power-struggle and test others to see how long they can go
    - Don't start explaining things
    - No hugs / No nice guy
    - Show you are in charge at these situations 
    - Let your kid win time to time, but with non-important things  
    - Let kid learn consequences of their actions  
    - Discipline the child and let them know they cannot do whatever they want
    - However, too much discipline is wrong and will become submissive 
    - Don't threaten with a punishment and then not do it (don't reward for not complying)
    - Once 4 years + - make sure rules of the house is clearly defined (however, they will still test the limits)
    - Fluctuations of self-confidence stops only after 12 + years
  - Bullying 
    - Is a dominant Paleolimbic behavior  
    - Do role playing and teach child how to say "No no no" in bullying situations
    - Get bully to become a friend 

#### Neolimbic Brain

- Home to deepest motivations and raw emotions
- Where memory resides 
- Identify situation and come-up with procedures to handle it 
- Highly efficient and free-up minimum required attention span to carry out a task. Hence, free-up mind to do multiple things at the same time (Drive and talk).
- 3 layers of motivation
  - Intrinsic motivations 
    - After 3 months will remain same throughout life 
    - Could lead to 8 different personality types
    - Motivates you regardless of whether you like what you do
  - Extrinsic Motivations 
    - Not fixed
    - Likes and dislikes 
    - Blueprint of cultural influences (socially expectable) 
    - Motivates you only if you like what you do (won't last forever)
      - Example: Motivation from a raise last 3 - 6 months
  - Obsessions
    - Passion that has gone over its tipping point 
    - When obsessed we are not just free (never satisfied of what you do towards the subject of the obsession)
- Expectations 
  - `The Pygmalion Effect` - How we think about others will influence how they perform 
    - Give list of high potential students (chosen just randomly) to a lecturer and measure success of students. 
  - `The Gollem Effect` - Negative expectations lead to negative outcomes 
  - Even when we try to hide our inner expectations, kids will pick those up from other signs 
  - Expecting too much  -> lead to raising insecure adults (with attachment issues)
    - Kids will feel that: if kids do not perform as expected, they do not deserve our love
  - No expectations ->  lead to brats who do not know how to stand up for themselves
  - `Focus on efforts not results`
  - Actions 
    - Discuss with your kids 
    - Setup rules together
    - Challenge them 
  - Look at the kids with love, compassion and pride. Look at their potential
  - You way of looking at them shapes who they will become
- Punishments and reward
  - Never make a threat you will not act upon. This will damage your authority.
  - Types of punishments 
    - Removing a toy
    - Timeout
    - Being grounded
  - Rules
    - Consequences have to be clear and accepted/agreed
      - If X happens what should be the consequences? Let them decide.
    - Transgressions should always have consequences 
      - No punishment = reward 
    - No drama
      - Explain what is the problem of doing X  (Ex: wall paintings / fighting while driving)
      - Ask from kid why he is doing X  
      - Give alternatives
      - Talk in isolation (individually)
- Parenting Styles 
  - Learned helplessness - By trying to make things easier in short term, we make things harder in long term
  - We should help but not right away. Let them try, get frustrated. 
  - When child come to you, offer help. Next time, child will be able to solve the problem on their own. 
  - *The Attachment Theory*
    - Kids require: Safety and Exploration
    - Securely Attached 
      - Parents that are attuned to their desires. 
      - Kids will fel secure when parents are around. 
    - Avoidantly Attached
      - Parents emotionally withdrawn. Child will learn to independently grow. 
      - Independent and mature. Fail to develop relationships with others. Not social.
    - Ambivalent/disorganized attached
      - Parents are inconsistent
      - Kids are confused. Grow to be more fearful. 
   - Let kid explore. When a paint point arrives share a story where you also had a similar pain. Tell them it's normal to feel that way and it's part of the life. Tell them that you are there if they need you to.
- Personality 
  - Factors of `Reptilian Brain`, experiences during newborn period affect personality. 
  - Forcing kids to become what we want to become if counterproductive.  
  - Let children experience the life. Let them learn what they like. Fulfillment, Joy and Happiness is ultimate goal.
  - Don't always reward or cheer too much. Doing so, yo might turn `intrinsic motivation` into `extrinsic`.
- Mindsets 
  - Fixed mindset - Focused on the result. 
    - Good grades is the focus. 
    - You avoid taking risks due to this focus.
  - Growth mindset - Focused on the process 
    - Putting effort in there and experimenting. 
    - Enjoying the process (journey) and taking a challenge. 
    - Less stress. Doesn't affect relationship.
- Complements
  - Complements reenforce identity
  - Praise the effort (not the end result)
    - Don't say: You are the best / That's beautiful / You are smart
    - Say: You worked hard / You applied yourself / You like to learn new things don't you?
  - Don't overdo it.
    - Brain get used to Dopamine rush
    - Will need stronger incentives 
    - Kid will like the praising more than the activity itself
- Do not ridicule or joke about a child. `Prefrontal brain` is not grown to handle this.
   
#### Prefrontal Brain

- Make humans unique: No other living creature has this structure the way we have it
- Using Reptilian and Paleolimbic brain -> No connection with local thinking ability
- Creating invocative solutions to the problem at hand 
- Adaptation / Creativity
- Should be the one dealing with new and complex situations
  - Not always the case. `Limbic brain` might be used in a situations where `Prefrontal` should be used. Example: 
    - `Harry potter book was turned down by several publishers`
    - `Idea of a personal computer`
  - Leads to resistance to change.
- Use all our knowledge  and creativity to see a possible future and then say "yes" or "no".
  - Might not be right decision
- Home to: 
  - creativity
  - intuition 
  - spirituality
  - adaptability
- WHen in use: we feel calmness and in full control. 
- Remaining calm:
  - Fast forward 10 years and think about it.
  - Look at the situation and imagine how it could be worst. Will enable Prefrontal and disable amygdala.
- Learning
  - Force kids to make mistakes. And let them learn from mistakes. 
  - Act of retrieving knowledge:
    - The more knowledge is retrieved, stronger the pathway in brain becomes
    - Let the kid do assignment on their own
    - Revisit with him later
    - Have them fail in the safe-environment and repeat until it's right.
  - Sleep improves memory by at least 15%
- Adolescence
  - 90% of full size by age of 6
  - From age 12, go through re-wiring
    - Adolescence is the adaptive period 
    - You should be there to support child's emotional needs (not the other way around)
    - Be the safe-haven
  - Age 24+ to fully mature brain
  - In human nature to product a creature optimally primed to leave a safe home and move into unfamiliar territory
    - Overcome fear of leaving safe world and take risks (and new allies)
  - `Dopamine` helps `fast learning`, `takin risks`
  - `Oxytocin` bounding hormone 
    - Creates feeling of `us` vs `them`. 
    - Creates hostility between you and teenager
  - In combination, creates a person:
    - Very active socially and sharing new stuff with them
    - Sensitive to peer pressure 
  - Teenagers weight reward and risk differently. `Dopamine` make reward look better.
  - Look at the attitude that drives the actions (not the results). 
    - Experimenting is not wrong.
  - Actions
    - Need framework and rules but flexible and evolving 
    - They will need independence to answer social needs 
      - If not give, Poleolimbic brain create a territorial battle
    - Stay connected
    - Put down rules (negotiate rules). You are not the enemy. 
      - Get their point of view and adjust the rules as required. 
      - Write consequences clearly. 
    - Sleep is important. Create rules around that. 
    - Language center mature at 13 years. After that we cannot pickup anything as a 2nd nature.  

#### Common 

- Submissiveness, Introversion and Shyness
  - Submissiveness 
    - About obedience
    - Part of Paleolimbic Brain
    - Should be avoided
    - Talk: Is your kid bullied kicked upon
  - Introversion
    - Character traits
    - People who are introverted tend to be inward turning, or focused more on internal thoughts, feelings and moods rather than seeking out external stimulation.
    - Part of Neolimbic Brain  
    - Talk: Is your kid like to be alone (introverted)
  - Shyness
    - About social fear
    - Part of Reptilian Brain (freeze)
    - Talk: Is your kid scared of others who he doesn't know 
      - Invite same age kids to home (one at a time)
      - Introduce the kid to other one
      - Ask other kid some questions and then involve your kid on answers 
- Help delaying gratification 
  - When you promise something do it
  - When they want something make them earn it
    - Action means reaction
    - There are consequences to actions
- Screentime
  - Limit to less than 1-2 hours per day
  - Less than 3 years non at all
  - Due to: 
    - Gray matter atrophy
    - Loss of white matter integrity 
    - Reduced cortical thickness 
    - Impaired cognitive function
  - `Dopamine` instant gratification
    - A rush with each game win, or video you watch
    - Kids never get this type of `dopamine` rush in non-screen environment
    - Therefore everything else becomes dull, and make you unable to focus
  - Humans are social animal by nature. Screen reduce social skills.
  - Sleep deprivation. Blue light LED, which disrupt `melatonin`.
  - Keep it controlled from the start.
