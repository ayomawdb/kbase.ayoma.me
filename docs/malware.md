**YARA**

- Rule-based approach to create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns.
  - Rules are composed of two sections:
    - strings definition (optional)
    - condition
  - Example rule:
    ```
    rule dummy 
    {
        condition: true 
    }
    ```
    ```
    rule silent_banker : banker
    {
    meta:
        description = "This is just an example"
        threat_level = 3
        in_the_wild = true
    strings:
        $a = {6A 40 68 00 30 00 00 6A 14 8D 91}
        $b = {8D 4D B0 2B C1 83 C0 27 99 6A 4E 59 F7 F9}
        $c = "UVODFRYSIHLNWPEJXQZAKCBGMT"
    condition:
        $a or $b or $c
    }
    ```
  - Sections 
    - Meta Section
    - Strings Section
      - Specifies the strings that are used to identify. 
      - In YarGen, there are three categories of these strings, marked by `$s`, `$x`, and `$z`.
        - `$s` ("Highly Specific Strings") are very specific strings that will not appear in legitimate software.
          - Server addresses
          - Names of hacking tools and malwar
          - Typos in common strings
        - `$x` ("Specific Strings") are likely to be indicators of malware files, but might also appear in legitimate files.
        - `$z` are likely to be ordinary but are not currently included in the goodware string database.
    - Condition Section
      - Boolean expressions that specify the additional conditions of that rule.

- awesome-yara: <https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara>
- Rule Sets:
  - yara-forensics: <https://github.com/Xumeiquer/yara-forensics>
    - set of rules that search for magic headers on files and dump files like raw image of `dd`
  - Rules: <https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules>
  - Rules by Neo23x0: <https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/tree/master/yara>
  - AlienVaultLabs: Malware related to APTs: https://github.com/AlienVault-Labs/AlienVaultLabs
- Analyze: `yara <yara-rule> <target-file>`
  - `-m`: print metadata of rules satisfied 
  - `-c`: print number of matches (`file path:match result`)
  - `-s`: print matching string (`hexadecimal virtual address:$string identifier:string value`)
  - `-p`: prefix the description
- Analyze using multiple rules:
    ```bash
    for file in $(find PATH-TO-DIRECTORY-CONTAINING-RULES -name '*.yar'); do 
        test $(yara -c ${file} PATH-TO-FILE) -gt 0 && echo $file;
    done 2>/dev/null
    ```
- yaraGen - Creation of yara rules from strings found in malware files while removing all strings that also appear in goodware files. yarGen includes a big goodware strings and opcode database: <https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen> 
    ```bash
    python yarGen.py --update
    python yarGen.py -m PATH_TO_MALWARE_DIRECTORY
    ```
  - A YarGen rule can be:
    - simple rule
    - super rule: If multiple sample files are used, YarGen will try to identify the similarities between the samples and combine the identified strings into a "super rule". Metadata section has: `super_rule = 1`.
      - Simple rules generated for each file is still there. 
      - Overlap of rule strings between the simple rules and the super rule. 
      - `--nosimple` to remove simple rules.  
      - `--nosuper` not to create super rules. 
  - Options:
    - `--excludegood`: exclude all of the goodware strings
    - `--score flag`: output the scores as comments in the rule file
    - `-rc` (maxstrings): maximum number of strings to include in each rule (20 by default)
    - `-z` (min-score): minimum score a script should have to be included in rule
    - `-a`: author
    - `-r`: reference
